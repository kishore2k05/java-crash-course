# JAVA-CRASH-COURSE

This repository contains all the code, exercises, and examples for the complete Java Crash Course. It is structured into multiple modules, starting with environment setup and basic syntax, and progressing through object-oriented programming (OOP) and collections.

## üíª Module 01: Setup and Basic Syntax

**Folder:** `module-01-setup-and-syntax/`

This foundational module covers the initial environment setup and the absolute core rules required to write and execute Java programs. The goal is to ensure the local development environment is working and that students understand fundamental Java conventions.

### Topics Covered:

| Concept | Description | Corresponding File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Environment Setup** | Verification that the Java Development Kit (JDK) and IDE (VS Code) are configured correctly. | `HelloWorld.java` |
| **Standard Output** | Using the `System.out.println()` command to display output to the console. | `HelloWorld.java` |
| **Program Structure** | The basic components of a Java class and the `main` method entry point. | `HelloWorld.java` |
| **Comments** | Writing single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/*...*/`) comments to document code. | `Comments.java` |
| **Case Sensitivity** | Demonstrating that Java is case-sensitive and the importance of precise capitalization. | `CaseSensitive.java` |

### Key Files in This Module:

* **`HelloWorld.java`**: The traditional "Hello, World!" program used to validate the entire setup.
* **`Comments.java`**: Example file illustrating proper use and syntax of different comment types.
* **`CaseSensitive.java`**: Code to show how the Java compiler distinguishes between identically spelled identifiers with different cases.

### Important Note on Files:

The `.class` files (e.g., `HelloWorld.class`) are **bytecode** generated by the Java compiler from the `.java` source files. They are typically ignored from version control using the `.gitignore` file, but are included here for demonstration.
